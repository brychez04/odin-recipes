    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 slices of choice bread. Best picks are white, wheat, rye, even a roll or bun.</li>
        <li>Sliced turkey (ham works too)</li>
        <li>Bacon</li>
        <li>Lettuce (romaine is best, but any works)</li>
        <li>Roma or vine tomato</li>
        <li>Condiment of choice, mayo or mustard are best</li>
        <li>Pickles (optional, but trust)</li>
        <li>Pan or skillet, paper towel, tongs</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat your pan to medium high heat. Once its heated, lay down 2 pieces of bacon on it.</li>
        <li>While the bacon is cooking, pick some leaves of your lettuce and wash them. Cut them into shapes that fit your bread 
            if needed
        </li>
        <li>Check your bacon. If it's smaller and slightly browned, flip it with tongs. Once the bacon looks crispy and browned, take
            them off the pan and put them on a paper towel.
        </li>
        <li>Grab your bread and toast them on medium low heat in the same pan. Don't worry about residual grease form the bacon, it
            will add flavor to the bread. You can also wipe down the pan before toasting if you prefer no grease.
        </li>
        <li>Now wash and slice your tomatoes. You'll want about 2 - 4 slices depending on what your bread can fit, each slice being
            1/8th inch thick.
        </li>
        <li>Lets start assembling your sandwhich. First, apply condiments to the bottom slice/bun. The condiment type and amount is up to you.</li>
        <li>Next, put on your slices of ham or turkey. Again, the amount is up to you, but keep in mind if your sandwhich is too packed
            with ingredients, it will make a mess. 
        </li>
        <li>Now, grab that glorious bacon and put it on top of the turkey/ham.</li>
        <li>Finally, put on your tomatoe, lettuce, pickles, and top piece of bread. Enjoy your BLT. </li>
    </ol>
