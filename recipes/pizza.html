    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Homemade pizza dough or store bought pizza crust <a href = "https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/the-best-pizza-dough/">(Here's an article on making your own pizza dough).</a></li>
        <li>Pizza sauce</li>
        <li>Shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Cooking oil or spray</li>
        <li>Toppings (pepperoni, vegtables, sausage, etc)</li>
        <li>Pizza griddle/stone or large baking tray</li>
        <li>Brush (to apply oil)</li>
        <li>Pizza cutter or sharp knife.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 450F</li>
        <li>Spread about 2 handfuls of flour over your kitchen countertop and start kneading the dough on it. The flour
            is to prevent the dought from sticking onto the surface. If you have store bought crust, skip to step 3
        </li>
        <li>After about 30 seconds of kneading, add more flour and start shaping your dough into a quarter to half-inch thick disk
            about the size of your pizza griddle or baking tray. You can use your hands or a rolling pin for this.
        </li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of oil on your griddle, then fit the dough you just shaped onto the griddle. If your disk is too
            big, grab the excess dough and fold it into the edge of the pizza so it fits. If its too small, keep shaping the disk. 
        </li>
        <li>Now, it's time to add the rest of the ingredients. Start with a thin layer of souce that covers all the dough.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle cheese evenly to your liking. You can never have too much cheese.</li>
        <li>Spread your desired toppings evenly over the pizza.</li>
        <li>Brush light oil onto the crust part of your pizza, then leave in the oven at 450F. You'll want to check the pizza at around 
            5 minutes, then every couple minutes after that. Pull out the pizza as soon as the crust is dark golden brown and the cheese is completley melted.
        </li>
        <li>Once your pizza is done cooking, let it cool on the counter for a few minutes. Then slice it using your pizza cutter or knife. When using
            a knife to cut pizza, make short, consistent, vertical cuts so that you don't pull cheese and other ingredients when slicing.
        </li>

    </ol>
